## What is a conjoint simulator?
<div class='build'>
<p>This is a market reseach tool that provides a 'utility estimate measure' for different potential products or services that are to be offered. In this particular application, the seller is a communications company (Internet services) and utilities for 3 potencial services at a time will be obtained. </p>

<p> A conjoint simulator is mainly thought of as a room with a number of consumers (100,500, 1000, etc) who vote for the products or services that are offered. Finally, there will be a percentage for each product or service which represents the predicted proportion of consumers that would buy it. Here consumers are segmented so filters are available. </p>

## What does the seller need to do here?

The services that will be assessed consist of combinations of different attributes each with different options. For example:

- Combo plan 1: T-mobile, Up to $30, 2MB, No Wi-Fi
- Combo plan 2: Verizon, $30 - $50, 5MB, Customized Wi-Fi service

are two different services that a company may offer. The simulator asks the seller to enter 3 combo plans. The attributes are carrier company, price, velocity and extra Wi-Fi service.

## What is inside a conjoint simulator?
Here is a little simulated example of what is done. Two services will be assessed. The utility matrix has utilities for each level of each attribute and intercept, for each of 5 consumers.
```{r}
set.seed(21432345)
utilities=data.frame(matrix(rnorm(5*5,5,3),5,5))# must be previously obtained
names(utilities)=c("b0", "at1_op1", "at1_op2", "at2_op1", "at2_op2") 
ser1<-c("b0","at1_op1","at2_op2");         ser2<-c("b0","at2_op1","at2_op2")
ser1_id<-which(names(utilities)%in%ser1); ser2_id<-which(names(utilities)%in%ser2)
servs_sum<-data.frame(s1=apply(utilities[,ser1_id],1,sum),
                      s2=apply(utilities[,ser2_id],1,sum))
services_perc<-apply(apply(exp(servs_sum),1,function(x)x/sum(x)),1,mean)
data.frame(Combos=c("Combo plan 1", "Combo plan 2"), 
           Share=paste(round(services_perc*100,2),"%"))
```

## Make decisions on what you get from the simulator
<div class='build'>
<q> Well, there should be no doubt about what service to sell, should it? </q>
</div>
```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis', message=FALSE}
require(googleVis)
Share=c(31.6, 68.4)
Services=c("Combo plan 1", "Combo plan 2")
data_to_plot<-data.frame(Services, Share) 
Pie <- gvisColumnChart(data_to_plot,options=list(colors="['purple']",width=800, height=400))

print(Pie, tag='chart')
```
